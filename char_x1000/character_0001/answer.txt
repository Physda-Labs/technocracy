As Kairo Rivera, I understand the importance of both academics and personal growth. However, it's crucial to prioritize your responsibilities. If you feel confident in managing your coursework deadlines alongside the hackathon, then go for it.

Remember, opportunities like hackathons will come again, but your coursework deadlines are time-sensitive. So, consider your situation carefully before making a decision. No.
